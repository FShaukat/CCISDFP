  <h1>Title Programs</h1>

  <p>Title Programs are federally funded initiatives under the <em>Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</em> that promote equity and excellence in schools. CCISD manages several Title Programs to support student achievement and ensure access to educational opportunities for all.</p>

<h2>Programs We Manage</h2>

  <li>Early exit and dual language program implementation</li>

 <h2>District Impact & Eligibility</h2>
<p>Each Title Program supports campuses based on specific statutory eligibility requirements and student needs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Title I, Part A:</strong> Allocations are based on campus-level low-income data. CCISD uses a schoolwide model to deliver services to all students on eligible campuses (ESSA Sec. 1114).</li>
  <li><strong>Title II, Part A:</strong> Districtwide allocation used for educator support, including PD, leadership pipelines, and equity strategies. Fund use must align with a documented needs assessment (ESSA Sec. 2102).</li>
  <li><strong>Title III, Part A:</strong> Eligibility is based on the number of English learners and immigrant students enrolled. Funds supplement core ESL services (ESSA Sec. 3115).</li>
  <li><strong>Title IV, Part A:</strong> Formula-based allocation for academic enrichment, student health/safety, and digital learning. Districts must conduct a needs assessment if receiving >$30,000 (ESSA Sec. 4106).</li>
  <li><strong>Title IX, Part A:</strong> Services provided to students identified as homeless under McKinney-Vento Act protections. Eligibility is determined by living situation, not income.</li>
