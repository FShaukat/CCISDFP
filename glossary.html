  <h2>Budget & Financial</h2>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Allowable Cost</div><div class="term-definition">An expense that is permitted by the grant and necessary to complete the project's goals. Examples include curriculum materials, staff stipends for grant-related activities, and travel for project implementation. Costs must be reasonable, allocable, and documented.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Unallowable Cost</div><div class="term-definition">Any expense explicitly prohibited by the grant’s rules. Common examples include entertainment, personal gifts, and any cost unrelated to the project’s goals. Always confirm questionable costs with the Grants Office to ensure compliance.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Budget</div><div class="term-definition">A detailed estimate of expenses expected during the grant period. Budgets break down costs line-by-line, such as $2,500 for instructional supplies or $1,200 for after-school snacks for participants.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Budget Narrative</div><div class="term-definition">A written justification for each item in your budget. This explains how each cost supports the project, helping reviewers understand why the funds are needed and appropriate.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Indirect Cost</div><div class="term-definition">Expenses that support the project but aren't tied to a specific activity, such as utilities or administrative support. Most grants limit the amount of indirect costs based on a negotiated rate.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Match</div><div class="term-definition">A required financial or in-kind contribution by the district or partners. This may include cash from department funds, staff time, donated space, or services provided by collaborators.</div></div>

Maintaining fidelity shows accountability and ensures the program’s effectiveness can be evaluated properly.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Logic Model</div><div class="term-definition">A visual or written representation that outlines the project's structure: Inputs (resources), Activities, Outputs (deliverables), Outcomes (short-term effects), and Impact (long-term change). A strong logic model connects activities to measurable results.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Project-Based Approach</div><div class="term-definition">Designing grant proposals around clear, time-bound, goal-oriented efforts. Instead of describing daily duties, this means framing ideas as specific initiatives with objectives and measurable outcomes—for example, a semester-long afterschool robotics program.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Sustainability Plan</div><div class="term-definition">A description of how the project will continue after grant funding ends. This may include training staff, integrating activities into regular budgets, or forming long-term partnerships.</div></div>
  <div class="term"><div class="term-header">Timeline</div><div class="term-definition">A schedule showing when major project activities will occur, including start/end dates, milestones, and deadlines for deliverables and reports.</div></div>
